OLED Library for graphics
The OLED library uses adafruit_ssd1305 and adafruit_framebuf (Both are modified for furbadgebadge RV1)

OLED functions:

#Functional#
Test() tests the OLED. It shows 2 patterns to check if connection and hardware is ok. Horizontal lines and vertical lines after.
Bench() a benchmark
Power(bool:power) Turns 12V booster on/off safely

#Images#
show_image(bitarray:image) Shows an array of bits(bools atm) on the OLED 
store_frame(bitarray:image, ID) Stores an array of bits to render later. This is really fast. (ID does nothing atm. Images are appended right now)
show_frame(ID) Shows image from stored frames. This is really fast. From benchmark it shows ~2ms drawing time. 
remove_frame(ID) To do  

#Direct#
driver. directly accesses the framebuf and SSD1305 driver 
https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/framebuf/en/latest/api.html?highlight=framebuf
driver.pixelf(x,y,color) Modified framebuf.pixel(). It's faster.
